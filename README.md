## Deaths by Tuberculosis
by Craig Warren 03 August 2019.
 This is my first project for the first part of The Open University's _Learn to code for Data Analysis_ course.

**Tuberculosis** (TB) is a bacterial infection spread through inhaling tiny droplets from the coughs or sneezes of an infected person. It is a serious condition, but can be cured with proper treatment. TB mainly affects the lungs. However, it can affect any part of the body, including the glands, bones and nervous system.
 TB does not make the news headlines like other epidemics such as Ebola or SARS, but TB is far more deadly.

The source of the data used in this project is the World Health Organization(WHO). If you would like to learn about what the WHO does, you can go to [The World Health Organization](https://www.who.int/)

Given the population and number of deaths due to TB in some countries during one year, the following questions will be answered:
* What is the total, maximum, minimum and average number of deaths in that year?
* Which countries have the most and the least deaths?
* What is the death rate (deaths per 100,000 inhabitants) for each country?
* Which countries have the lowest and highest death rate?

### The Data

The data consists of total population and total number of deaths due to TB (excluding HIV) in 2013 in all of the countries in the world.
The data was taken in August 2019 from http://apps.who.int/gho/data/node.main.POP107?lang=en (population) and http://apps.who.int/gho/data/node.main.1317?lang=en (deaths). The uncertainty bounds of the number of deaths were ignored.
 The data was collected into an Excel file.
